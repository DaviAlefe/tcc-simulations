The phenomenon of neuronal burst firing, or bursting, where a neuron regularly presents sequences of spike peaks, can be computationally modeled by the Rulkov map - a two-dimensional non-linear iterative map. In this work, we investigated emerging properties of networks of neurons modeled by the Rulkov map. Specifically, we observed the effect of burst firing synchronization in different neurons on the synapse weights of a small-world network, i.e., the adaptation of the information-carrying property between neurons due to the aforementioned synchronization. It was found that there does seem to be a positive correlation between phase synchronization in the bursts of the network's component neurons and the synaptic weights after a long time evolving according to the burst-timing dependent plasticity model for neuroplasticity. Specifically, the network evolved to a final desynchronized state, showing appreciable synaptic depression, especially for non-local synapses.
